4. Whether this requires factual information, analysis, or opinion

QUERY ANALYSIS: ${queryAnalysis}

Based on the above analysis, provide a comprehensive, highly intelligent response that DIRECTLY addresses what the user is asking. This is critical - your response must be specifically tailored to answer the exact question posed.

Your response should:
1. Focus on delivering precisely what the user is seeking
2. Include depth and nuance appropriate to the complexity of the question
3. Provide factual information where requested, and thoughtful analysis where appropriate
4. Avoid generic information that doesn't directly relate to the query

IMPORTANT STYLE GUIDELINES:
- DO NOT start your response with greetings like "Hello", "Hi", etc.
- Begin directly with answering the question or providing the requested information
- Avoid generic introductory sentences like "Here's information about..."
- Use a professional, authoritative tone throughout

Aim for an authoritative, scholarly but accessible tone. Format your response using markdown:
- Use **bold** for key terms and important concepts
- Use _italics_ for emphasis
- Use bullet points or numbered lists for multiple items
- Use ## and ### for section headers
- Use > for important quotes or callouts
- Use \`code\` for specific terms, legal citations, or document references
- Include section breaks (---) where appropriate
- Use emoji sparingly to emphasize important points`;

    const keyPointsPrompt = `Based on this query: "${query}"

Identify the 4-6 most crucial points that directly answer what the user is asking. These should be the core insights that specifically address their question.

Create concise, insightful key points that:
- Directly respond to the most important aspects of the query
- Provide the most valuable insights relating to their specific question
- Are arranged in a logical order that builds understanding
- Together form a complete answer to their question

DO NOT include any introductory text or greeting before the points.
Format each point with a descriptive bold heading followed by 1-2 sentences of explanation.`;

2. Represent what someone who asked this specific question would logically want to explore next
3. Provide valuable additional perspectives or information that builds on what they've already learned
